### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Javier Marasco, I am a Cloud Engineer with passion for automation, scripting, home automation, kubernetes and sailing.

In my repositories you will find some tools I made to make my life easier that I hope they can also help you!

If you find something that is not right or can be improoved please let me know, I am happy to make this repositories better :)

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkbexkGQuztKdHcPokl7iIA) (in Spanish) where I upload videos about different topics I like to share (SRE/Cloud/IT)
I also [stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/javi__codes) (in English), normally I use that space to work on personal projects or tools that I upload in here later.
You can also find my other networks in [here](https://linktr.ee/javi__codes)

I like to share my knowledge and interact with others, please reach back if you have any question or comment on anything you find in this repo or in any of my videos or streams.
